# Wastewater Lagoons

These are the stock files of a web map showing the spatial distribution of lagoon wastewater treatment facilities serving small communities (less than 10,000 
population equivalent). 

# Why it exists

It is one of the outputs of a larger US EPA funded research that aims to provide accessible technical, economic and environmental data 
to promote contextual, cost-effective technology options to improve nutrient removal in wastewater lagoons serving small communities. 

# Where the data came from

The data sources used to prepare this web map include: [U.S EPA's Lagoon Inventory 2022](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiL4rjC9J_-AhXRMVkFHZtmB_gQFnoECBoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2F2022-06%2Flagoon-inventory-2022.xlsx&usg=AOvVaw3mFUW2-omVJu1gSNMJqs8d), [Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database](https://echo.epa.gov/), [Integrated Compliance Information System National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (ICIS-NPDES) databases](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/icis-npdes-download-summary), and [Clean Watershed Needs Survey (2000-2012) datasets](https://www.epa.gov/cwns).
