# Wastewater Lagoons
These are the stock files of a web map showing the spatial distribution of lagoon wastewater treatment facilities serving small communities (less than 10,000 
population equivalent). It is one of the outputs of a larger US EPA funded research that aims to provide accessible technical, economic and environmental data 
to promote contextual, cost-effective technology options to improve nutrient removal in wastewater lagoons serving small communities. 


# Data
The data sources used to prepare this web map include: U.S EPA's Lagoon Inventory 2022, the Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database, 
the Integrated Compliance Information System National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (ICIS-NPDES) databases and the Clean Watershed Needs Survey 
(2000-2012) datasets.
